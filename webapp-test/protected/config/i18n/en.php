Our success is impossible without our team and many other wonderful minds behind the scene. We strive to find the best talent who are passionate about our vision. We work hard to create the best environment for them to do things they love. We respect their previous achievements and also their privacy. We will introduce more about our team on our Medium in the future. <a href="mailto:team@iost.io" >Contact us</a> if you want to join and make an impact!<br>',

    We are seeking a seasoned community manager who is ready to take their career to the next level. You will contribute heavily to our US community engagement and be an instrumental part of our success. We will count on you to oversee all online channels and local communities as we build awareness of and support for our scalability solutions. This requires a thoughtful and data-driven approach to optimizing the levers for growing IOST’s community.
    <br/><br/>
    Applicants should have a proficient understanding of blockchain technologies and a high level of comfort interacting with the underlying base of active community members. An ideal candidate is active within the blockchain ecosystem and has a knack for pinpointing what motivates and grows these online communities. Applicants will work cross functionally with the rest of the team to engage and grow our active base of community members.
